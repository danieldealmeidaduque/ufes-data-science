<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="justify">
    Using the data acquisition web tools (urllib and BeautifulSoup), data processing tools (pandas, scipy, etc.), data visualization tools (matplotlib and seaborn), and classification tools (sklearn, DecisionTreeClassifier) learned in the Introduction to Data Science classes and self-research, analyses and classifications of the Brazilian stock exchange (Ibovespa) actions were performed based on their financial indicators.    
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The problem consists of analyzing and classifying the stocks listed on Ibovespa based on their financial indicators. The analysis will be performed by dividing the stocks according to their sectors and visualizing the indicators in comparison with "rival" stocks. This will enable us to obtain insights for their classification. The classification will be done by comparing the financial indicators of the stocks for each sector and determining whether the stock is worth buying or not based on its current price, as well as analyzing graphically to make the comparison easier.
